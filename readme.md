# Scalable Walkability Analysis of Accra
Repository of a data science project at Ghana Telecom University Accra.

## Purpose
'Walkability Index' of a suburb measures how 'walkable' a given neighborhood is, in terms of road connectivity, population density, and land use mix.

Using data from the Open Street Map Directory, this project explores possible statistical and spatial analysis of large areas (Accra), by breaking them down into smaller chunks, 
and aggregating them during analysis. This approach allows us to calculate, and present the walkability metric for intuitively understandable areas linke suburbs or greater regions.
